# How-To:
#
# python HTTPSend.py [-s] [-q] filename.http [filename1.http] ...
# Works on files containing http requests in given order
# If -s option is provided, use https
# If -q option is provided, do not print response
#
# freitsabes@gmail.com
#
# Possible future improvements:
#  - When folder is provided instead of files, go through files in folder alphabetically.
#  - add error handling
